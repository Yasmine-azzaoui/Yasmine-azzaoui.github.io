    <h1>Hi, I am Yasmine </h1>

   <p> A Data Analyst that currently works in Martech and is passionate about data and technology. <br>
    I'm currently expanding my coding skills as a student at SheCodes.
    Throughout the next 6 months I'll be deep diving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, React, Django and Python.  <br>
    I'm aiming to develop a holistic understanding on all things tech, which will provide me with a strong foundation to dive into AI and Machine Learning.
    <br>
    Are you interested to learn more about me? Let's connect!
